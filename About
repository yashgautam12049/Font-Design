FONT DESIGN


I have named my font as "Handmade" because it is designed to be both attractive and easy to understand. The curviness of the font makes it particularly suitable for children, helping them easily recognize the shapes of letters and numbers. The rounded and flowing design mirrors natural handwriting, encouraging young learners to develop their writing skills with pen and paper.
Additionally, "Handmade" is crafted to be visually engaging, capturing a child's attention and making learning more enjoyable. The font's playful and approachable style fosters a sense of creativity, making it easier for children to connect with the alphabet and numbers. By choosing this font, I aim to create a fun and friendly learning environment that supports children's early literacy and writing development.
